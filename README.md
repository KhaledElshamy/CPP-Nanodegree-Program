# A* Search Algorithm 
- contained in the folder A* Algorithm 
- Implemented an A* grid-based search algorithm.
    > is very similar to other search algorithms you may have seen before, such as breadth-first search,   except for the additional step of computing a heuristic and using that heuristic (in addition to the  cost) to find the next node.
